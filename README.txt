Explainer - program created for learning purposes in Python.
Explainer lets the user choose one of the saved topics (names for the "issue" class objects) and displays its explanation.
It will display longer explanation if the user does not confirm understandig (as long as issue object has any explanations left)
User can also run explainer_topic_creator to create new issue objects or run explainer_topic_remover to remove existing, saved issue object.

Data for issue objects are stored in separate folder as a text file.
Names of the files are topics and lines iside them are the explanations.


uses os, class, multiple scripts and lot of intputs and conditional statements.
